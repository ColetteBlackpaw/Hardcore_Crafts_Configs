# Hardcore_Crafts_Configs


A config mod for papershredder432's MoreHideoutCrafts mod, aimed at hardcore players of SPT-AKI.


To install this mod, first install papershredder432's "MoreHideoutCrafts" mod into your user/mods folder.
Next, drag the configs of your choice to user/mods/shredder-MoreHideoutCrafts/src/configs, and drop them there.

And they're installed!

And overview:

Way_More_Weapons.json contains crafting recipes for nearly every single firearm in vanilla SPT. As far as I am aware, I did not miss any - however if I have, please let me know via DM on the SPT-AKI hub.
These recipes require intelligence items as a form of sub-leveling your crafting workbench. More rare, powerful, unique, or lore-wise difficult to obtain weapons require intel items such as Terragroup "Blue Folder" Materials, where items such as a PM Makarov, or TOZ-106 do not require any intel items.



Extra_Meds.json contains crafting recipes for many more medkits, as well as recipes to refill said medkits. This creates refillable meds for hardcore players that may not have access to, or have limited access to traders, as well as making certain meds more worth keeping in general for early-game players, such as being able to refill the Grizzly kit continuously.



I hope you enjoy this mod config, and if you want to support me and my modding adventures, you can find my Ko-Fi here https://ko-fi.com/meowletteblackpaw and my SPT profile here https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/user/14651-meowletteblackpaw/
